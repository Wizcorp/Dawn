# Cluster setup

When creating your environment using one of the provided templates you will get:

 * An ansible folder with `playbook.yml` and `group_vars`
 * Optionally an inventory file

## Ansible

The default `playbook.yml` will deploy a vanilla version of the cluster with
everything working out of the box. If you need custom iptables or software
installed on the cluster this is the file to edit.

Meanwhile the `group_vars` folder should contain a single file called `all` that
contains a set of default variables for your cluster.

### Variables

## Inventory

The inventory in dawn uses several groups to automatically decide how to provision
machines on the cluster, these groups are `control`, `edge`, `worker` and `monitor`.

Refer to the concepts documentation for more details on the meaning of each group.

### Minimum inventory

```ini
# The list of control nodes
[control]

# Monitoring nodes is where elasticsearch/prometheus is started, for now only
# one instance is supported
[monitor]

# Edge nodes run traefik, one is usually sufficient for most project but if you
# start to see load feel free to add more
[edge]

# Workers are where your app will run, feel free to add as many as you want
[worker]

```
