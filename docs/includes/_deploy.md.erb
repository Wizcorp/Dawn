### Internal DNS

Every container has direct access to the consul DNS feature, this allows a
container to access any of the primary service through the internal
`<local_dc>.<local_domain>` domain, for example if you want to leverage the
provided consul for service discovery or kv storage, you can simply point your
application to `consul.service.<local_dc>.<local_domain>` to connect to a random
consul node in the cluster.

For more information about the Consul DNS, see the [DNS Interface Documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/dns.html).

Another useful DNS entry that is made available is the `dockerhost` entry which
points to IP of the machine currently running your container and could be used
to declare a service on the local consul agent or find out the IP of the host
machine for service discovery when using `docker run` instead of `docker service`.

If you need to talk to the swarm, it is recommended to instead use the
`control.swarm.service.<local_dc>.<local_domain>` domain instead since it will
point you to one of the manage nodes.
