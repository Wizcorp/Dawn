## Extra features and goodies

Dawn comes with some extra functionalities to help you interact with your cluster

### Internal DNS

Every container has direct access to the consul DNS feature, this allows a
container to access any of the primary service through the internal `in.dawn`
domain, for example if you want to leverage the provided consul for service
discovery or kv storage, you can simply point your application to `consul.service.in.dawn`
to connect to a random consul node in the cluster.

For more information about the Consul DNS, see the [DNS Interface Documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/dns.html).

Another useful DNS entry that is made available is the `dockerhost` entry which
points to IP of the machine currently running your container.
