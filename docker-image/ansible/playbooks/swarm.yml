  # This task is related to how overlay networks behave. The way overlay works
  # is that it will mark your packet at the mangle stage with the service id you
  # are trying to reach, IPVS then catches those marked packets and route them
  # dynamically to the right target. The issue is that ipvs will stop tracking
  # an idle connection after 900 seconds, after that any packet on this
  # connection will not be routed properly and try to access the original virtual
  # IP associated with the task, resulting in failure since that IP doesn't exists.
  # By setting the tcp_keepalive below 900 we make sure that the connection will
  # never expire in ipvs.
