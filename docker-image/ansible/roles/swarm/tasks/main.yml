# This task is related to how overlay networks behave. The way overlay works
# is that it will mark your packet at the mangle stage with the service id you
# are trying to reach, IPVS then catches those marked packets and route them
# dynamically to the right target. The issue is that ipvs will stop tracking
# an idle connection after 900 seconds, after that any packet on this
# connection will not be routed properly and try to access the original virtual
# IP associated with the task, resulting in failure since that IP doesn't exists.
# By setting the tcp_keepalive below 900 we make sure that the connection will
# never expire in ipvs.
#
