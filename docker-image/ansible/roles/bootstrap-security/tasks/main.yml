      Security bootstrap is finished and 2 files have been generated/saved on disk:
      * {{ vault_local_root_config }}
      * {{ vault_local_ansible_config }}

      The first file is your root credentials and unseal keys and will be needed for
      manual root operations and unsealing the vault on restarts. It is not necessary
      to have it to run the normal playbooks but should be safely stored/backup.

      The second file is your ansible credentials and will need to be present any time
      you run the normal provisionning playbooks to config TLS keys for both consul and
      docker.

      Press ENTER to continue the provisining process.
